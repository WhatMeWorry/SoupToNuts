     Create a new file in you project directory
     Will use CheatSheet.txt for example


 $ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   README.md

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        CheatSheet.txt

The new file which we just created, resides in the Working directory (because we created it
there - or was moved there if we say created the doc on our desktop).  It is refered to as
"Untracked" because it is still raw (never added to Staging area or repository)

$ git add CheatSheet.txt

Adding a Remote Repository
$ git remote
origin

$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/WhatMeWorry/SoupToNuts.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/WhatMeWorry/SoupToNuts.git (push)

shows url that is going to be used for fetching and the url for pushing. 
Typically the same but you might have a read only repo used for pulling 
and a different (writeable one) repo for pushing.


$ git remote add nameWhateverYouWant https://github.com/WhatMeWorry/Delivery.git


$ git remote
SomeNameWhateverYouWant
origin

$ git remote -v
SomeNameWhateverYouWant https://github.com/WhatMeWorry/Delivery.git (fetch)
SomeNameWhateverYouWant https://github.com/WhatMeWorry/Delivery.git (push)
origin  https://github.com/WhatMeWorry/SoupToNuts.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/WhatMeWorry/SoupToNuts.git (push)

============================================================
Removing a Remote Repository
$ git remote rm SomeNameWhateverYouWant


$ git remote add delivery https://github.com/WhatMeWorry/Delivery.git

=============================================================
Cloning a repository is how you work with an existing repository someone else 
has already created, "Hey, I want you to come work with me on my project soAndSo"

Cloning a repository is nice because it becomes automatically tracking.

$ git clone https://github.com/WhatMeWorry/SoupToNuts.git  myLocalSoutToNuts

$ cd myLocalSoupToNuts

$ git remote -value

==============================================================
Difference between git remote add and git clone

git remote add just creates an entry in your git config that specifies a name for a 
particular URL. You must have an existing git repo to use this.

git clone creates a new git repository by copying an existing one located at the URI you specify.

They are functionally similar (try it!):
 # git clone REMOTE_URL foo
and:
 # mkdir foo
 # cd foo
 # git init
 # git remote add origin REMOTE_URL
 # git pull origin master

A lot of commands, whether git commands or common programs, do things in one line you could 
otherwise do in ten. It's always good to save work!

That said, your steps are close to, but not entirely the same as, what git clone does. I can 
think of a few differences, all to do with branches:

If, for some reason, the remote's HEAD is not master, the clone will do the right thing - 
give you a branch named the same as the remote's, instead of master. This is rare, but a good 
detail to be aware of.
Your git pull won't create any remote branches. If the remote has several branches, the clone 
creates remote branches remotes/origin/foo, remotes/origin/bar, ... in your repository. A git
 fetch origin would take care of that in your listed steps.
You also haven't set up your master branch to track origin's, which the clone does. You could 
add this to your listed steps as git config branch.master.remote origin; git config 
branch.master.merge refs/heads/master. This is very significant - with your steps, if you 
have master checked out and you type git pull, it won't know what to do.
It's possible I've missed a thing or two. As for difficulties one way or the other, even 
assuming you iron out all the differences between a default clone and a "manual clone", my 
advice would be not to reinvent git clone:

It's short. Why do more work?
It's got handy options to change its behavior. Things like --shared would be really difficult 
to add to your listed commands.
It's guaranteed to do the right thing now and in the future. What if you missed a detail, like 
the ones above? What if git added a global config parameter that affected clones? You'd have to 
change your commands to take it into account, but git clone would already know.

Remember:  git pull = git fetch + git merge.  Recommend to use git getch and git merge until you 
have a good understanding of fetch and merger.  Then start using pull as a shortcut.

======================================================================

git clone requires that you already have an existing remote repo on GitHub. git clone REMOTE_URL foo
or git remote add origin REMOTE_URL both need a URL.

git and github are separate entities and the only way to have git add a remote repo programmatically
is with the help of curl.  

Using an existing remote repo as a pattern:
https://github.com/WhatMeWorry/SoupToNuts.git

curl -u USER https://api.github.com/user/repos -d 

Make sure to replace USER and REPO with your github username and the name of the repository 
you want to create respectively

$ cat ~/.gitconfig
# This is Git's per-user configuration file.
[user]
# Please adapt and uncomment the following lines:
#       name = Kyle Heaser
#       email = kheaser@eapl.org

curl -u "Kyle Heaser" https://api.github.com/user/repos -d '{ "name": myproject }'

https://github.com/WhatMeWorry/myproject.git

How do I delete a local repository in git?

Delete the .git directory in the root-directory of your repository if you only want to delete the git-related information (branches, versions).

If you want to delete everything (git-data, code, etc), just delete the whole directory.

Git keeps all of its files in the .git directory. Just remove that one and init again.

If you can't find it, it's because it is hidden.

In Windows 7, you need to go to your folder, click on Organize on the top left, then click on 
Folder and search options, then click on the View tab and click on the Show hidden files, 
folders and drives radio button.

On a Mac OS:
Open a Terminal (via Spotlight: press CMD + SPACE, type terminal and press Enter) and do 
this command: defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles 1 && killall Finder.
Or you could also type cd (the space is important), drag and drop your git repo folder 
from Finder to the terminal window, press return, then type rm -fr .git, then return again.

On Ubuntu, use shortcut Ctrl + H.


$ rm -r SoupToNuts

-f, --force
    ignore nonexistent files, never prompt
-i
    prompt before every removal

--------------------------------------------------------------

If you just use rm, you will need to follow it up with git add <fileRemoved>.  git rm 
does this in one step.

You can also use git rm --cached which will remove the file from the index (staging 
it for deletion on the next commit), but keep your copy in the local file system.

If you really want to remove all of the repository, leaving only the working 
directory then it should be as simple as this.

rm -rf .git
The usual provisos about rm -rf apply. Make sure you have an up to date backup 
and are absolutely sure that you're in the right place before running the command

If you want to delete all .git folders in a project use the following command:

find . -type f | grep -i "\.git" | xargs rm
This will also delete all the .git folders and .gitignore files from all subfolders

push is a separate command is because of git's philosophy. git is a distributed versioning 
system, and your local working directory is your repository! All changes you commit are 
instantly reflected and recorded. push is only used to update the remote repo (which you 
might share with others) when you're done with whatever it is that you're working on. This 
is a neat way to work and save changes locally (without network overhead) and update it 
only when you want to, instead of at every commit.

===============================================================
Fetching changes from a remote repo
git fetch origin 

git fetch before you start work.
git fetch before you git push
git fetch often.  Expecially like before you get on an airplane, or take a working vacation.






==============================================================
why git pull can be bad

Before I explain the advice about git pull any further it’s worth clarifying what 
a branch is. Branches are often described as being a “line of development”, but I 
think that’s an unfortunate expression since:

If anything, a branch is a “directed acyclic graph of development” rather than a line.
It suggests that branches are quite heavyweight objects.
I would suggest that you think of branches in terms of what defines them: they’re 
a name for a particular commit and all the commits that are ancestors of it, so 
each branch is completely defined by the SHA1sum of the commit at the tip. This 
means that manipulating them is a very lightweight operation – you just change that value.

This definition has some perhaps unexpected implications. For example, suppose 
you have two branches, “stable” and “new-idea”, whose tips are at revisions E and F:

  A-----C----E ("stable")
   \
    B-----D-----F ("new-idea")
So the commits A, C and E are on “stable” and A, B, D and F are on “new-idea”.
 If you then merge “new-idea” into “stable” with the following commands:

    git checkout stable   # Change to work on the branch "stable"
    git merge new-idea    # Merge in "new-idea"
… then you have the following:

  A-----C----E----G ("stable")
   \             /
    B-----D-----F ("new-idea")
If you carry on committing on “new idea” and on “stable”, you get:

  A-----C----E----G---H ("stable")
   \             /
    B-----D-----F----I ("new-idea")
So now A, B, C, D, E, F, G and H are on “stable”, while A, B, D, F and I are on “new-idea”.
