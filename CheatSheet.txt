     Create a new file in you project directory
     Will use CheatSheet.txt for example


 $ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   README.md

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        CheatSheet.txt

The new file which we just created, resides in the Working directory (because we created it
there - or was moved there if we say created the doc on our desktop).  It is refered to as
"Untracked" because it is still raw (never added to Staging area or repository)

$ git add CheatSheet.txt
